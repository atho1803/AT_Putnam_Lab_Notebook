# Water Quality Protocols
### Make sure to record all measurements legibly and with proper units in the lab notebook that stays in the aquarium room
### Write the date and time of measurements taken every day

## Temperature (C)
1. The temperature probe is stored by the microscope and has a thin silver probe.
2. Wipe off the metal portion of the probe with DI water and a kimwipe.
3. Press the power button to turn the probe on and place the metal portion of the probe in each of the water tanks (no need to clean in between).
4. Record the measurements in Celsius when the probe stops varying more than 0.1 C.
5. Turn the probe off.
6. Rinse the metal portion of the probe with DI water and dry it.
7. Wipe off the meter box with a kimwipe and 70% ethanol to remove any water or salt.
8. Store the probe by the microscope.

## Salinity (psu) -make sure calibration standards are at 25 C for most accurate calibrations
1. The salinity probe is stored in CBLS on the shelf near the titrator. Therefore we have to fill up 4 capped plastic falcon tubes with ~20mL of water from each tank and bring them upstairs in a rack.
2. Calibrate the probe once a week using 12.9 ms/cm standard solution and 14.13 ms/cm standard solution. To do this remove the probe from its buffer and rinse with DI water.
3. Turn the probe on by pressing the power button and place in 12.9 ms/cm standard solution, then press calibrate and accept.
4. Rinse with DI water and place in 14.13 ms/cm standard solution and press calibrate and accept again.
5. Rinse again with DI water and submerge the probe in each tube of tank water; record the measurements when the probe stays on "ready."
6. When finished, rinse the probe with DI water and pat dry.
7. Place the probe back in the storage buffer.
8. Wipe off the meter box with a kimwipe and 70% ethanol to remove any water or salt, and place back on the shelf.

## pH (mV)
1. Rinse the tip of the probe with DI water and turn it on.
2. Submerge the tip of the probe in each water table; when the probe settles and says "ready" record the pH in the lab notebook.
3. When finished rinse the probe with DI water and place it back in the storage solution.
4. Wipe off the meter box with a kimwipe and 70% ethanol to remove any water or salt.
5. Stor the probe by the microscope and make sure it is stable/safe, as this instrument is expensive.


## Light (umol/m^-2/s^-1)
1. The light probe is attached to a long stick and is stored by the microscope.
2. Remove the blue rubber cap from the probe.
3. Wipe the probe and a few inches of the cord and stick with DI water.
4. Press the power button to turn the probe on.
5. With the translucent side facing up, position the probe near the same depth as the egg crate or samples to take the measurements, making sure to not cast a shadow with the stick or your arm.
6. Move the probe to 3 positions across the tank and record each measurement.
7. Then replace the plexiglass and move the probe to 3 positions across the tank to make sure there is not a huge difference with the glass.
8. Turn off the probe when done by pressing the power button.
9. Rinse the probe with DI water and pat dry.
10. Wipe off the meter box with a kimwipe and 70% ethanol to remove any water or salt.
11. Place the probe back by the microscope for storage.
