### A copy of the Jebao DP-4 manual included with the pump can be found [here](https://www.fish-street.com/manual/jebaodosingpump.pdf), and a pdf copy is in the protocols folder [here](https://github.com/atho1803/AT_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/JebaoDosingPumpManual.pdf).

- We have pumps 1-4, options 5-8 are for additional pumps you can hook up to the system.
- To see the inside of the pumps or replace them, press on the two plastic parts that jut out on either side of each individual pump face. Push them down and pull out at the same time to remove the white plastic outside part.
- NOTE: PUMP 2 IS FINICKY and the metal bar inside of it sometimes does not seem to catch the white plastic outside part.

## Set the date and time.

1. First, plug in the box. Press any button to turn on the display, which shows the date and the time.
2. Press the middle "right angle" arrow to see the main menu. You will see "set date and time" or "set program."
3. Navigate up and down using the up and down arrows, and use the middle arrow to select "set date and time."
4. Use the sideways arrows to shift between month, day, year, and hour, minute, and second. Use the up and down arrows to change the time.
5. Once the date or time is correct press the middle arrow to save your inputs and return to the main menu.

## Manually check each of the 4 pumps' flow.

1. Plug in the box. Press any key to turn on the display.
2. To check the pumps' flow manually, press either of the sideways arrows to enter the pump testing menu.
3. Navigate to pumps 1-4 with the sideways arrows and test each one by holding down the middle arrow.
4. If the pump is working normally you should hear and see it spinning. (NOTE: PUMP 2 IS FINICKY and the metal bar inside of it sometimes does not seem to catch the white plastic outside part.)
5. Press "esc" to return to the starting display.

## Calibrate each pump before use.

1. Plug in the box. Press any key to turn on the display.
2. To calibrate the amount of liquid the pump doses, press the up or down arrows to enter the calibration menu.
3. Navigate to pumps 1-4 with the sideways arrows and calibrate each one one at a time, by selecting them with the middle arrow.
4. Make sure to hook up the left tube for the pump you're working on to a container of liquid and the right tube to a container with mL measurements to output the liquid.
5. Press the up arrow when you are ready to start calibrations, and the liquid will begin flowing.
6. Press the up arrow when your container has filled to the 100mL mark, and the numbers next to "100mL=" on the display should stop.
7. Press the middle arrow to accept the number, which you can test out by programing 100mL for that pump (discussed in the next section) and seeing how close of an amount the pump outputs.
8. Press "esc" to return to the starting display once pumps 1-4 are calibrated.

## Programing the pumps

1. First, plug in the box. Press any button to turn on the display, which shows the date and the time.
2. Press the middle "right angle" arrow to see the main menu. You will see "set date and time" or "set program."
3. Navigate up and down using the up and down arrows, and use the middle arrow to select "set program."
4. Use the sideways arrows to shift between which pump you would like to set and select it using the middle arrow.
5. First you will see "P# Time Per Day," which you can change from 1 to 24 times the pump will dose in liquid per day, using the up and down arrows. Press the middle arrow to accept.
6. This will move you on to "P# Interval Day," which ranges from 0 to 30 day intervals, 0 being no intervals, using the up and down arrows. Press the middle arrow to accept.
7. This will move you on to "P# Dosing Volume," which you can change from from 0 to 9,999mL, using the up and down arrows. Press the middle arrow to accept.
8. This will move you on to "P# Dosing Time," where you can set the hour and the minute that the pump will dose your set amount. Press the middle arrow to accept and return to the pump programing menu, and press esc to return to the starting display.
9. Repeat steps 4-8 to set each pump.
10. Press "esc" to return to the starting display once pumps 1-4 are programed, and wait for them to work!
