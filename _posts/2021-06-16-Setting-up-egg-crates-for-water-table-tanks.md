## Egg crates (or plug racks according to Alice) can be used to hold and arrange coral samples in big tanks.
- The maximum size egg crate that the large tanks can fit is 32x75 boxes, or 20.5x47.5 inches (pictured [here](https://github.com/atho1803/AT_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/Tank_2_Egg_Crate.jpeg)).
- The maximum size egg crate that the feeding bins can fit is 13x19 boxes, or 12.25x8.5 inches (pictured [here](https://github.com/atho1803/AT_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/Feeding_Egg_Crate.jpeg)).

1. To make egg crates to fit our big tanks in the aquarium room, find scraps and large pieces under the end of Tank 1.
2. Put on your safety goggles, because this stuff can fly everywhere!
3. Use the widest/farthest back part of a pair of scissors to cut the rows and columns to your desired size. Cutting with the tip of the scissors is much harder. (This will take a lot of hand strength, but scissors are the best tool we have found so far.)
4. If you want, clamping and bending the plastic with the scissors has worked too, although the plastic sometimes breaks into more pieces and can sometimes break the neighboring squares.
5. Cut close to the edge of the square to create as smooth of lines as possible, so people do not scratch or cut themselves.
6. Lastly, sweep up the plastic scraps and put them in the garbage can. Return any good sized scraps to under Tank 1.
