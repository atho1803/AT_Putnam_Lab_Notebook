## Lessons learned getting onto URI internet...
1. Non-URI visitors can access URI wifi by getting "sponsored access."
2. Go to [this website](https://uri.makekb.com/entry/82/) and navigate to "How to sign up for a sponsored Guest Account"
3. Make sure you are connected to URI_Open on the device you want to connect (this connection can be...finicky).
4. Go to the URI Wi-Fi page [here](rhodywifi.uri.edu)
5. Click on "Guest network access"
6. Click on the hyperlinked "here"
7. Fill out the form with the necessary information (from someone with a URI email, post docs are allowed to do this), and click "Register"
8. A confirmation screen should appear after clicking "Register" and it should change once you've been granted access
9. You will be texted your username and password
10. Go to rhodywifi.uri.edu and click "Guest network access"
11. Put in your username and password and click "Log In to Sponsored Guest"
12. You should now be connected to URI wifi, although in our experience this often takes too long to submit and there is no confirmation, so it does not connect.
13. You have access for 2-10 days, but your sponsor can email the IT desk to extend this time if necessary.
