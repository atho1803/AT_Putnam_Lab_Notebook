I am an undergraduate student studying biology and geography. I strive to understand the interactions of environmental and climate justice and marine biology and ecology, focusing on coastal ecosystems and tropical coral reefs. I am specifically interested in investigating coral acclimatization through symbiosis, genetics, and epigenetics.
